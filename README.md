It is the good old 2048-game implemented using the react-native.

I did not change the gameplay much but presented all the tiles in the form of logos of the most popular cryptocurrencies. In addition, all the crypto-currencies are sorted  according to their market capitalization. So in the end, by manipulating the tiles, you need to collect the most expensive coin - Bitcoin.

Features:
• Single-player sliding block puzzle game
• New stunning design of the old game
• Tiles distribution, according to the capitalization of the cryptocurrency
• Easy gameplay
• Only for real crypto geeks

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
